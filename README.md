 Microsoft's New Movie series will be a block buster!
 

Task: Present to Microsoft on how they can penetrate the movie industry successfully. I analyzed the data and found previous movies financial records. 


# Business Problem

Microsoft is interested in the movie industry. Their lack of experience has led them to source
out a specialist in the field. I will inform Microsoft of the proper steps and strategy while 
using visualization tools, looking at historic data will allow us a clear vision and path.  
Creation of a film series from book novels has loyal customers already following the theme. 
Finding a book novel series that has yet to be created into a film with an extraordinary author, this is no easy task but will lead to a positive outcome. Becoming profitable with a reasonable production budget will be revealed in the data. 
Questions being considered:
What are the top films with the most financial success?
What novel series to transform into film?
Production Budget cost ?
Lead role and film distributor? 
Understand the film industry through data?


# Data
I’ve chosen to analyze two datasets (tmdb.movies.csv.gz, tn.movie_budgets.csv.gz). After review I’ve combine them into one main data frame “Clean”. Missing data appears to be an issue and will be omitted. 
When encountering lack of data I will be utilizing googles resources to engineer another data frame. The most valuable dataset is “tn.movie_budgets” because it provides budget and gross revenue.  This resource is highly recognized for revenue across many dimensions, combined we have over 30 thousands data points



## Methods
created roi and foreign column to evaluate which movie is having he most success.  
creating dataframes to compensate for the lack of data provided.



## Results
Production budget $150,000,000 per movie 
Lets go make 13.6 billion dollars !
16 movies ( 8 Anime remakes )
Production years 32
Author Stephen King  (Novel series Dark Tower )
Novel series “Dark Tower” ( 8 books)
Diverse Genre Dark fantasy, Science Fantasy, Horror, and Western
Film Distributor Walt Disney leads the way in distributing film series
Director Jon Favreau ( Marvel series Director )
Lead role Tom Holland (previously starred in a marvel film series “Spider man” )
The Foreign market will be necessary to reach our revenue goal.
